            Running gait assessment is critical in improving performance and
            injury prevention. On top of that, gait assessments also help
            diagnose certain pathologies or assess people’s health and recovery.
            Traditional approaches to running gait assessment are often
            constrained by unnatural running environments such as indoor labs.
            The experience is also very subjective, and the cost of equipment
            for such an assessment is very high.

            Use of wearables devices (smartwatches and smart rings) have shown
            promise but despite their flexible use in any environment and
            reduced cost, they still face issues with connectivity to mobile
            platforms and inaccurate measurements.
          </p>
          <p>
            With that, development of valid, reproducible and low-cost
            approaches are key. Simple vision-based systems have a considerable
            potential in this area, as they allow the capture of gait in
            unconstrained environments, such as at home or in a clinic, while
            the required computations can be done remotely.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this tutorial, we will explore a non-wearable camera-based
            approach to running gait assessment, focused on identification of
            initial contact events (the moment when the foot touches the ground)
            within a runner’s stride.
